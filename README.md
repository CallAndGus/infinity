There's a famous painting hidden among the integers in the set of Natural Numbers.
Michelangelo's [Creation of Adam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Creation_of_Adam)
happens to reside at this number:

<sub>NB: I've elided most of the lines for brevity; you can download all digits of 
the full number [here](https://github.com/armhold/infinity/blob/master/samples/creation_of_adam-number.txt).)</sub>

That is a number with 160,165 digits. It's a simple (though long) integer on the number line,
and it happens to contain Michelangelo's Creation of Adam. It's always been there, even
before Michelangelo created his famous fresco in 1511.



### Background

Anything that can be described as a sequence of bytes can also be described by a single, 
very large integer. Just take the bytes and stack them end to end. You can interpret these 
bytes as a single integer. By definition, that integer appears in the set of
[Natural Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number).

So in a sense, everything that can be expressed digitally (software programs, books, music,
pictures, etc) **already exists**- we just have to find it on the number line.

This means that, for example, the Bible appears in the set of numbers- all possible versions of it. 
Same for the Koran, and every other book that's ever been written (or will be written). 
Tomorrow's newspaper is in there. **Your photographs** and **your favorite movie** are all in there too.

This program explores how we can discover the numbers associated with digital files.


### Really Big Numbers


Any file contains a sequence of bytes- we string these bytes together to create a single number.
Each byte has eight bits of storage. Every added bit doubles the potential "range" of numbers.
Since a byte has eight bits, each time you add a byte, the range is doubled eight times.

This quickly leads to some pretty big numbers.

A kilobyte of data (1024 bytes- not at all a big file) is 8,192 bits. To get a ballpark idea
of where that data might lie on the number line we need to double "1" 8,192 times.
That's 2<sup>8192</sup>, or about **1.09 Ã— 10<sup>2466</sup>**.

That's more than the number of atoms in the universe. A big number for sure, but still a number.

### Demonstration

Consider the string "ABC". This can be written as three bytes. In decimal, the bytes are (assuming
ASCII/Unicode) 65, 66, and 67. In binary, this gives us:

    A = 65 = 01000001
    B = 66 = 01000010
    C = 67 = 01000011

If we concatenate the binary, we get:

    01000001 01000010 01000011  
     
Or 4,276,803 in decimal. So the number for the string "ABC" is 4,276,803. Therefore "ABC" exists
on the number line near the 4.2 millionth number.

This project includes a program to print the number line "coordinate" for any file. Install it
like this:

    $ go install github.com/armhold/infinity/...
    
Now you can use it to get the number coordinate for any given file like this:    
    
    $ find_number some_file.jpg
    [ ... pages of numbers omitted...]
    
Or if you just want to look for a particular word or phrase, you can do:

    $ find_number -t "meaning of life"
    568016600252838567935837243227858533

And if you already have a number, and you'd like to see what it holds:

    $ decode_number -n 568016600252838567935837243227858533
    meaning of life


### Wait, aren't you just *encoding* this data?

In a sense, yes. You can check the source code (it's very short) and see how it works- we take a sequence of letters,
turn them into bytes, and then print the bytes as a long number. It doesn't change the fact that at the end,
you get a single number back; a number that maps to your data, which has always been there in the number. This
program merely identifies where it resides.

A somewhat spooky corollary to this, is the fact that you cannot ever edit or delete your data. Like some kind of
cosmic blockchain, the data exists in the number line- it's always been there, and there is no way for you
to remove it. Take comfort in the fact that infinite variations and permutations of the numbers exist, and
from our perspective, it's mostly just noise.
